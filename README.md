Assume that you often send packages from Virginia to New York. Create a program that calculates the shipping cost based on number of pounds. The rules are as follow:
weight up to 5 pounds - $ 1.20 per pound
5 < weight <=10 - $ 1.00 per pound
10 < weight <=20 - $ 0.90 per pound
weight >20            - $ 0.80 per pound

The program receives a package weight from Keyboard, and prints a message similar to the following:
Your package weight is 15 pounds, the cost of shipping is $ 13.5
